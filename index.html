                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>On Halloween night in 2021, instead of passing out candy, I wrote my first program on the family computer. After following a Python tutorial by freeCodeCamp on YouTube, I continued learning different programming languages. I practiced game development in C# and Unity, Java for a robotics team, and machine learning with PyTorch. However, I found myself returning to the C programming language. Although it was not my first love, C sparked my interest in computer engineering. Today, I use my experience in web development to log my journey as a programmer. Shortly after I started programming, my nephew was born. Watching him grow reminds me of the value of patience.</p>
